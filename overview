To do this project, we need Git,Jenkins,Ansible,Docker,k8.

Flow of project
Git > Github > jenkins > Ansible > Docker > K8s

1. Code is pushed into github
2. Jenkins will start build
3. In ansible,

we move files named webapp.war,Dockerfile,build-push.yaml,web-deployment.yaml,web-service.yaml,k8-playbook into ansible through jenkins.
Then playbooks build-push.yaml, k8-playbook will do their job

In build-push.yaml,
        webapp.war,dockerfile will be moved to docker_server and image will be builded, then pushed to docker hub.

In k8-playbook.yaml,
        definition files web-deployment.yaml,web-service.yaml will be moved to k8 server & pods are created
